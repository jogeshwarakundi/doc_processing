    "Section: Monthly Per\u2011Member\u2011Per\u2011Month (PMPM) Payments in Lieu of Fee\u2011For\u2011Service Reimbursement\n\n1. Purpose\nThis Section describes the Parties\u2019 agreement to compensate Provider by way of monthly per\u2011member\u2011per\u2011month (PMPM) payments for the provision of the Defined Services in lieu of fee\u2011for\u2011service reimbursement.\n\n2. Definitions\n- \u201cPMPM Rate\u201d means the agreed dollar amount per Member per month for the Defined Services, as set forth in Exhibit A (or other referenced schedule).  \n- \u201cDefined Services\u201d means the specific services covered by this PMPM arrangement and listed in Exhibit B.  \n- \u201cMember\u201d means an individual enrolled with the Payer and attributed to Provider under the attribution rules in Exhibit C.  \n- \u201cMember Month\u201d means one Member enrolled and attributed to Provider for any portion of a calendar month, unless otherwise specified.  \n- \u201cCapitation Period\u201d means the contract period or calendar year for which PMPM payments are calculated.  \n\n3. Payment Methodology\n- Payer shall pay Provider a PMPM payment for each Member for each Member Month that Member is attributed to Provider, subject to any withholds, adjustments, carve\u2011outs, exclusions, and reconciliations described herein.  \n- The PMPM payment is intended to cover all costs of furnishing the Defined Services unless an item or service is expressly carved out as Fee\u2011For\u2011Service (FFS) or otherwise excluded in Exhibit B.\n\n4. Calculation and Timing\n- Monthly Payment Calculation: Monthly Payment = (PMPM Rate) \u00d7 (Number of Member Months in the month).  \n- Payer shall provide Provider with an invoice or remittance advice each month specifying the PMPM Rate, Member count, and total payment. Payments are due within 30 days of invoice date (or as otherwise agreed).  \n- Mid\u2011month enrollment changes: A Member who is enrolled for any portion of a month shall generally be counted as a full Member Month unless Exhibit C specifies pro\u2011rata treatment.\n\n5. Invoicing, Payment, and Reporting\n- Payer shall remit payments electronically to Provider\u2019s designated account and include a detailed remittance report showing Member identifiers (as permitted by privacy laws), Member counts, PMPM rate, gross payment, withholds, prior period adjustments, and net payment.  \n- Provider shall timely submit any required billing information and reports necessary for reconciliation.\n\n6. Withholds, Incentives, and Risk Sharing\n- The Parties may agree to withhold a percentage of PMPM payments for quality, performance, or risk\u2011sharing purposes as detailed in Exhibit D. Withheld amounts shall be released or reconciled in accordance with the performance measurement and payment schedule in Exhibit D.  \n- Any upside/downside risk arrangements, shared savings, or shared losses are described in Exhibit D and are applied in addition to PMPM payments as specified.\n\n7. Exclusions and Carve\u2011Outs\n- Services that are excluded from the PMPM arrangement (for which Payer will pay FFS or otherwise) are listed in Exhibit B. Carve\u2011outs may include, but are not limited to, inpatient hospital services, pharmacy, specialty services, behavioral health, or services mandated by law to be paid FFS.\n\n8. Reconciliation and Retroactive Adjustments\n- Quarterly and annual reconciliations will be performed to compare aggregate PMPM payments to allowable costs, encounter submissions, utilization targets, or other reconciliation metrics specified in Exhibit E.  \n- Retroactive eligibility changes, retroactive adjustments due to claims processing corrections, or corrections of enrollment/attribution errors shall be reconciled in the next scheduled reconciliation period. Net amounts owing by either Party as a result of reconciliation shall be paid within 60 days of determination, unless otherwise agreed.\n\n9. Audit Rights and Recordkeeping\n- Provider shall maintain records necessary to support PMPM calculations, enrollment/attribution, and performance metrics for a period of at least six (6) years. Payer (or its designees) shall have the right to audit such records during normal business hours upon [30] days\u2019 notice. Findings resulting in payment adjustments shall be reconciled per Section 8.  \n- All audits shall be conducted in a manner that protects patient privacy and complies with applicable law.\n\n10. Attribution, Enrollment Changes, and New Members\n- Member attribution methodology and rules for handling enrollment starts, terminations, transfers, and ambiguity are set forth in Exhibit C. Provider shall be informed promptly of changes that affect PMPM calculations.  \n- Newly enrolled Members shall be included in PMPM payments beginning [the first of the month following enrollment/first day of enrollment month], as specified in Exhibit C.\n\n11. Termination and Transition\n- On termination or expiration of this Agreement, Parties shall perform a final reconciliation of PMPM payments and adjustments covering the Contract Year or termination date. Any net balance due shall be paid within 60 days of final reconciliation.  \n- Provider shall continue to provide services for any Members during any transition period as required by law or this Agreement; funding/settlement for that period shall be addressed in the transition plan (Exhibit F).\n\n12. Compliance, Taxes, and Regulatory Changes\n- The Parties shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations governing payments, taxation, reporting, and privacy (including HIPAA where applicable).  \n- If a change in law or regulation materially alters the cost or viability of the PMPM arrangement, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an appropriate amendment to rates, scope, or payment mechanics.\n\n13. Disputes and Remedies\n- Disputes regarding PMPM calculations, reconciliations, or adjustments shall be handled per the Dispute Resolution provisions of this Agreement. Pending resolution, amounts not in dispute shall be paid in accordance with this Section.  \n- Except as expressly set forth herein, remedies for nonpayment, underpayment, or breach are governed by the General Terms of this Agreement.\n\n14. Survival\n- The provisions of this Section necessary to effect final reconciliation, audit, payment, and dispute resolution shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement for the duration specified in Section 9.\n\n15. Exhibits\n- Exhibits referenced in this Section shall identify: PMPM Rate(s) (Exhibit A), Covered and Excluded Services (Exhibit B), Attribution Rules (Exhibit C), Quality and Risk\u2011Sharing Terms (Exhibit D), Reconciliation Methodology (Exhibit E), and Transition Plan (Exhibit F).\n\nExample calculation (illustrative):\n- If PMPM Rate = $25 and attributed Member count for March = 10,000, March Payment = $25 \u00d7 10,000 = $250,000 (less any agreed withholds or adjustments).\n\n[End of Section]\n\nIf you want, I can: (a) tailor this section to a particular state law or payer/provider type, (b) draft the Exhibits (A\u2013F) with sample language, or (c) convert this into numbered contract language with cross\u2011references to other Agreement sections.

    "Responsibilities include coordinating patient-centered care across settings by developing and updating individualized care plans, facilitating transitions and referrals, communicating with patients, families and the interdisciplinary team, and ensuring timely access to appropriate services and community resources. In utilization management, responsibilities encompass conducting prospective, concurrent and retrospective reviews to verify medical necessity, authorizing or recommending alternative levels of care, managing prior authorizations and appeals, and working to contain costs while preserving quality through evidence-based guidelines. For outcomes reporting, duties involve defining and tracking key performance indicators (clinical outcomes, utilization, readmissions, length of stay, patient experience and cost metrics), analyzing data to identify trends and gaps, preparing regular internal and external reports required by payers and regulators, and using findings to drive quality improvement initiatives. All activities must be documented in the medical record, comply with regulatory and privacy requirements, and support continuous monitoring and improvement of patient care and resource use.",
    "Section: Shared Savings / Risk-Sharing Agreements Tied to Quality Metrics and Total Cost of Care\n\nPurpose\n- Establish a framework for aligning financial incentives between payor(s) and provider(s) to improve quality of care and reduce the total cost of care (TCOC) for a defined population, while protecting quality and access.\n\nKey Definitions\n- Total Cost of Care (TCOC): All allowed spending for the attributed patient population across care settings over a defined performance period.\n- Shared Savings: A model where providers who reduce TCOC below a benchmark receive a portion of the savings.\n- Risk-Sharing (Two-Sided Risk): Providers share in savings and also bear a portion of costs above the benchmark (losses).\n- Quality Adjustment Factor (QAF): A multiplier or offset based on performance on agreed quality metrics that modifies shared savings/losses.\n\nAgreement Structure Options\n- Upside-only (shared savings only): Provider earns portion of savings if TCOC < benchmark and quality thresholds met; no downside.\n- Two-sided risk: Provider receives savings but is also responsible for a portion of losses if TCOC > benchmark.\n- Corridor/Performance Threshold: A minimum savings/loss threshold (e.g., \u00b12\u20133%) before sharing applies to limit variance.\n- Cap and Floor: Limits on maximum shared savings or losses to control financial exposure.\n\nAttribution and Population\n- Attribution method: Prospective (assigned at start) or retrospective (based on claims during period). Clearly define inclusion/exclusion (e.g., Medicaid vs Medicare, dual eligibles).\n- Risk adjustment: Use an agreed model (e.g., CMS-HCC, clinical risk scores) to adjust benchmarks for case-mix and changes in population acuity.\n\nBenchmarking and Savings Calculation\n- Benchmark: Prior historical spending (rolling baseline), regional benchmark, or hybrid; adjust for trend and utilization changes.\n- Adjust for one-time events, coding intensity, and population shifts.\n- Calculation example:\n  - Expected cost (risk-adjusted benchmark) = B\n  - Actual cost for period = A\n  - Gross savings = max(0, B \u2212 A) or gross loss = max(0, A \u2212 B)\n  - Quality-adjusted shared savings = Gross savings \u00d7 Sharing rate \u00d7 Quality Adjustment Factor\n- Sharing rate: Negotiated percent (e.g., 50% of savings); different rates may apply across service lines.\n\nQuality Metrics and Performance\n- Select a balanced set of metrics tying financial outcomes to care quality, safety, patient experience, and preventative care. Categories:\n  - Clinical outcomes (readmissions, HbA1c control, blood pressure control)\n  - Utilization measures (ER visit rates, admissions for ambulatory-sensitive conditions)\n  - Patient experience (CAHPS scores)\n  - Preventive care and care coordination measures\n- Define measurement specifications, data sources, reporting cadence, thresholds for minimum acceptable performance, and how metric performance modifies shared savings (bonus/penalty or QAF).\n- Consider phased approach: start with process and utilization measures and add outcomes over time.\n\nData, Reporting, and Transparency\n- Regular reporting cadence (monthly/quarterly) with access to claims, encounter, and clinical data.\n- Standard data formats, KPIs dashboard, and audit rights for validation.\n- Dispute resolution process and reconciliation timeline (e.g., preliminary reports quarterly; final reconciliation annually).\n\nGovernance and Operations\n- Establish a joint governance committee (executive and clinical) to oversee performance, metric selection, corrective action plans, and appeals.\n- Care management, utilization review, and data-sharing protocols to support improvement.\n- Performance improvement plans for underperforming metrics with clear milestones.\n\nFinancial Flow and Reconciliation\n- Timing and method of payments/recoupment: periodic interim distributions vs annual reconciliation.\n- Withholds or performance reserves may be held to cover potential losses or quality shortfalls.\n- Tax and accounting treatment considerations.\n\nCompliance and Legal Protections\n- Address regulatory compliance (Stark Law, Anti-Kickback Statute, state laws), ensure arrangements meet safe-harbor requirements or are structured under value-based exceptions.\n- Patient protections: continuity of care, no reduction in access, clear communication about care management.\n- Data privacy and security: HIPAA-compliant data exchange and business associate agreements.\n\nRisk Mitigation and Contingencies\n- Stop-loss/maximum loss limits, reinsurance options for extreme variance.\n- Periodic re-baselining of benchmarks to avoid stale targets.\n- Mechanism for addressing major population changes (e.g., epidemics, facility closures).\n\nTermination and Transition\n- Define exit triggers (material breach, regulatory change), reconciliation procedures, final audit period, and responsibilities for open claims and patient transitions.\n\nImplementation Roadmap (high-level)\n1. Define population, attribution, and data feeds.\n2. Agree benchmarks, risk-adjustment method, sharing parameters, and quality metrics.\n3. Build reporting and reconciliation processes; governance structure.\n4. Pilot period with frequent reviews; refine metrics and calculations.\n5. Scale to full performance year, with annual re-evaluation.\n\nSample contractual language (short)\n- \u201cShared savings shall be determined annually by comparing the risk-adjusted benchmark to actual TCOC for the attributed population. Provider shall be entitled to X% of shared savings only if a Quality Adjustment Factor of at least Y% is achieved across the agreed metric set. In a two-sided model, provider shall be responsible for X% of any excess costs above the benchmark, subject to a loss cap of $Z per performance year and a corridor of \u00b12%.\u201d\n\nRisks and Considerations\n- Upcoding/coding intensity, data lags, and attribution disputes.\n- Provider financial strain under rapid downside exposure.\n- Need for robust care management infrastructure to achieve improvements.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft sample contract clauses tailored to a specific payer/provider type.\n- Propose a specific set of quality metrics and performance thresholds for your population.\n- Create an example calculation and reconciliation worksheet using numbers you provide.",
    "Periodic reconciliation and true-up processes involve regularly comparing actual utilization or experience to actuarial benchmarks and making adjustments to reflect over- or underutilization. At scheduled intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually), actuaries and finance teams reconcile utilization data, verifying data quality, applying credibility factors, and quantifying variances from expected costs or volumes. Material deviations trigger a true-up: financial adjustments to reserves, premiums, or vendor payments, accompanied by root-cause analysis to determine whether variance stems from data issues, temporary trends, or structural changes. Governance procedures define thresholds for automatic adjustments, approval workflows, stakeholder communications, and required documentation to ensure transparency and auditability. The process supports regulatory compliance, improves forecasting accuracy, and informs corrective actions such as benefit design changes, pricing updates, or utilization management initiatives to align future experience with actuarial expectations."
